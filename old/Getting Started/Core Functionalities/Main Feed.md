# Main Feed

## Introduction {#introduction}

Aikido's Feed is meticulously designed to streamline security management: it groups similar issues for clarity, allows for customizable views to highlight what's currently important. The main feed focusses on open issues only. Snoozed and ignored issues are accessible on a separate page for a clean giving a focused and clean overview. 

## Aikido's Main Feed {#aikidos-main-feed}

The **Feed** is the central hub for monitoring and managing security issues. A similar view can be found all over Aikido when going into details of repositories, clouds and domains.

By default, Aikido enables the **Focus** view, containing all issues that are important to follow-up. By toggling to **All** we will also show issues that have been auto-triaged and ignored.

*Status Column*

Shows the status of the particular issue. 

- *New*: issues that have been around for less than 7 days
- *To Do:* all other issues that are still unresolved
- *Task Open:* only when a task manager is linked
- *PR Open:* clicking will take you to PR / branch scan overview.

## Sidebar {#sidebar}

Aikido's Feed is equipped with a detailed sidebar, designed to provide users with comprehensive information and actionable options for each security issue. The image below shows the main important actions one can take.

**#1 Group Actions:** these are actions that can be taken on group level of an issue.

**#2 Subissue Actions:** you can also take actions on a subissue separately. This can be important when certain subissues want to be snoozed or ignored, but the overal issue group should remain in the main feed.

**#3 Reachability Analysis:** visualizes accessible code paths for that specific issue.

**#4 Detail Screen**: Separate detail screen with even more information (e.g., CVE information).
