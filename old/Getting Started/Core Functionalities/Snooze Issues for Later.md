# Snooze Issues for Later

## Introduction {#introduction}

Aikido introduces a flexible snooze feature that allows the snoozing of issue groups or subissues separately. This functionality clears the main feed of non-urgent items, providing a cleaner workspace to focus on immediate priorities.

## How to snooze issues {#how-to-snooze-issues}

**Step 1.** Navigate to the **issue group**, or **subissue** in Aikido you wish to snooze and select the "Snooze" option in the actions menu (triple dots).

**Step 2.** Choose the duration for snoozing: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, or specify a custom period.\

**Step 3.** Optionally, add a reason for snoozing to keep track of the decision-making process.\

​After snoozing, these items will disappear from the main feed, simplifying your view to focus on what's urgent.
