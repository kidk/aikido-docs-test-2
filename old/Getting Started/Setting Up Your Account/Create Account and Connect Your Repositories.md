As soon as you have done account setup and connected repositories, Aikido will instantly start a scan. Results will start coming in **within 1 minute. By connecting your repositories, you will already be benefiting from six different security scans** (SCA, SAST, Secrets, Licenses, IaC, Malware)**.**
