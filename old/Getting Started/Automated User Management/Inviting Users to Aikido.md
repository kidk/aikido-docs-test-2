# Inviting Users to Aikido

Aikido offers two primary methods for inviting users to your workspace: inviting users who are part of your organization and inviting users who do not have access to an organizational Git account.

## Inviting Users That Are Part of Your Organization {#inviting-users-that-are-part-of-your-organization}

> This is recommended as this allows for hassle-free automatic on- and offboarding of all your users.

By connecting to your organizationâ€™s Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), Aikido ensures a streamlined on- and offboarding process. This integration simplifies the management of user access and roles, ensuring that as users join or leave your Git organization, their access to Aikido is automatically adjusted.

## Inviting Users That Do Not Have Access to an Organization Git Account {#inviting-users-that-do-not-have-access-to-an-organization-git-account}

> No automated off-boarding is available for this option. You need to manually manage your users and deactivate them once access should be revoked.

This is especially useful for adding billing personnel, users with personal GitHub accounts, freelancers, and auditors requiring temporary access.
