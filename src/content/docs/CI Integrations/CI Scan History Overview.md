title: CI Scan History Overview
---


The CI Scan History feature in Aikido provides a detailed overview of all past CI scans, offering insights into their status, newly introduced issues, and resolved issues. This is important to keep an overview of all executed scans and allow you to quickly check the diff page from previous executed scans.

### How to check your CI Scan History
