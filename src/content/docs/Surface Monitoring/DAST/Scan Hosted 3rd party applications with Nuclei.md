Aikido's surface monitoring is built on top of [ZAP](https://help.aikido.dev/en/articles/8040614-surface-monitoring-scan-your-domain-names-with-owasp-zap) and Nuclei, a tool designed to provide an attacker's point of view on your hosted infrastructure. It probes your web-available services for known vulnerabilities, enhancing the security of your digital assets.

### What is Surface Monitoring Scanning?

Surface monitoring with Nuclei inspects all the externally-facing components of your infrastructure. It focuses on services like your GitLab server, WordPress website, and hosted Confluence server, among others. This approach helps identify vulnerabilities from an attacker's perspective, ensuring robust security.
