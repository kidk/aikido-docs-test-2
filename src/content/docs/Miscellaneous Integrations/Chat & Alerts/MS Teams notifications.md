### Connecting Aikido to MS Teams

Go to [the MS Teams integration settings](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations/notifications/ms-teams) inside of the Aikido app.

#### 1. Click "Add integration"

This will bring you to Microsoft's site where you need to log in to the account which has access to the MS teams team that you'd like to connect. After selecting a Microsoft to log in with, you'll be redirected back to Aikido.

#### 2. Select which MS teams team you'd like to connect

If you have access to multiple teams in MS teams, you'll have to select the team you'd like to connect on the page you get redirected to.

If you only have access to 1 team, you'll skip this step.

#### 3. Configure the alerts you'd like to receive

Once the connection to MS teams was successfull, you'll see the screen below where you can configure the alerts you'd like to receive. You can enable weekly digest and critical issue notifications to the channels you'd like.
