## Connecting the Aikido Slack app to Slack

Go to [the Slack integrations settings](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations/notifications/slack) inside of the Aikido app.

1. Click **"Add integration"**
2. Select **the Slack workspace** you'd like to use on the top right dropdown
3. Select **the channel** you'd like to post to from the dropdown menu
4. Click "**Allow**"

Repeat this process by clicking **"Add Channel"** in case you'd like to use different channels for different notification types.

## Adding the Aikido Slackbot to a private channel

To add the Aikido Slackbot to a private channel, you first need to invite the bot to that channel. Otherwise you're not able to select that channel. (This is so for all Slackbots)

1. **Type "@Aikido Security"** in the channel & send the message
2. You'll get a popup asking if you'd like to add Aikido to the channel
3. **Click "Add to Channel"**

1. **Enable the toggles** for the types of notifications you'd like to get
