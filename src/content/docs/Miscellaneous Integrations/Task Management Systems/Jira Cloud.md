*ðŸ“‹ Setting up automated task creation in Jira Cloud*

## Introduction

This one-time setup *per workspace* allows everyone in your Aikido organization to create issues directly in Jira Cloud.

Following use cases are supported :

- **Automated Ticket Creation**: Automatically create and push tickets to specified Jira projects for seamless tracking of security issues.
- **Manual Ticket Addition**: Manually add security issue tickets to Jira, ensuring targeted attention for critical vulnerabilities.

> Note: If the authorisation is linked to a person, we recommend using service accounts.

1. Navigate to [Integration Settings](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations) within the Aikido app.
2. In the 'Task Trackers' section, select 'Jira Issues'

## â€‹Options for Task Creation in Jira via Aikido

There are two different options to create new tasks from Aikido into Jira.

1. Manually create tasks from the Aikido interface
2. Automatically create new tasks via Aikido's auto creation functionality.

## 1. Manual Task Creation

1. Hover over any issue in your feed and click the ***+*** in the **assign column.**

   Alternatively, you can click the triple dots in the last columns to open up the action menu. If you have grouped issues, the triple dot action menu is available on every subissue.

4. Aikido will then autonomously generate Jira tickets based on these settings ðŸš€

### Jira Sync Information

Aikido automatically syncs a couple of fields to Jira

- Severity is mapped to the 'Priority field' in Jira (one way)
- Assignees are synced both ways (so updates in Jira will be reflected in Aikido too)
