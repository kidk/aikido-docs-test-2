***ðŸ“‹ Setting up automated task creation in Jira Data Center***

## Introduction

This article focuses on those companies that have Jira Data Center running (i.e., Jira on premise, different from [Jira Cloud](https://help.aikido.dev/en/articles/8680218-setting-up-automated-task-creation-in-jira-cloud)). The following one-time setup *per workspace* allows everyone in your Aikido organization to create issues directly in Jira On Prem.

Following use cases are supported :

- Automated Ticket Creation: Automatically create and push tickets to specified Jira projects for seamless tracking of security issues.
- Manual Ticket Addition: Manually add security issue tickets to Jira, ensuring targeted attention for critical vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

In order to make the connection to JIRA Data Center, you'll need to create a personal access token. This token will then be used to carry out all requests to your instance.\
â€‹\
Please note that the level of access the integration has will be equal to the person who created the personal access token (PAT). It's therefore advised to let a person with sufficient access rights in the environment to create the PAT.

To create a PAT, you can follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to your JIRA Data Center environment
2. Click on your avatar in the navigation bar on top and navigate to "Profile"
3. Click on "Personal Access Tokens", you should end up on a screen similar to the one below\

4. Click on "Create token" and give it an appropriate name
5. We advise to not set an expiry date, but if you do, you'll have to remind yourself to update the token in Aikido periodically
6. Once the token is created, you'll get to copy it momentarily, copy the token and keep it for the next step

## Connecting the Aikido App to Jira
