title: Link Existing Tasks
---


### Introduction

Aikido supports the linking of existing Task Tracker (e.g. Jira, Clickup) tickets to Aikido issues, crucial for integrating already flagged security concerns in Jira that are not yet connected to Aikido.

> Note: This functionality is only available for **Jira Cloud & Data Center, Linear, ClickUp** and **AzureDevops Boards integrations**. Contact us if you are using another integration and would love to see this functionality available too!

### How to Link an Existing Task

*Following example is for Jira. Functionality is similar for other task trackers.*

**Step 1:** Click on '**Add Task**'. For issue groups: located at the top of the sidebar or in the action menu. For subissues: triple dots menu on subissue level.\

**Step 3**.Select your project and search for the name of the existing Jira ticket. You can also just paste the URL into the search bar.\

​**Step 4:** Click 'Link Jira Task' to finalize the linking process.\

**Step 5:** Once linked, Aikido will automatically sync any updates in assignee and status from Jira, ensuring both platforms are up to date.
