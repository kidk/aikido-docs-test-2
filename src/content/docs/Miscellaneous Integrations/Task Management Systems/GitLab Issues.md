*ðŸ“‹ Setting up automated task creation in GitLab Issues*

Aikido can connect to GitLab so that you can create issues for security findings found through Aikido. For each of the findings in the 'Feed' of Aikido, a GitLab issue can be created, and linked.

You will be able to follow along in the Feed, to whom the ticket is assigned.

> Disclaimer: This integration only works for the GitLab Cloud version. This does NOT work with the GitLab Self-Managed version.

### 1. Set up integration

Go to <https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations> and scroll down to the 'Task trackers' section.

### 2. Create a GitLab issue for a finding, inside Aikido

Go to the [Feed](https://app.aikido.dev/queue), and go to the security finding of choice. In the column 'Assignee', you will find the ability to assign a GitLab Issue to someone.
