*ðŸ“‹ Setting up automated task creation in JetBrains YouTrack*

## Introduction

This one-time setup *per workspace* allows everyone in your Aikido organization to create issues directly in YouTrack.

Following use cases are supported :

- **Automated Ticket Creation**: Automatically create and push tickets to specified YouTrack projects for seamless tracking of security issues.
- **Manual Ticket Addition**: Manually add security issue tickets to YouTrack, ensuring targeted attention for critical vulnerabilities.

## Connecting the Aikido App to YouTrack

1. Navigate to [Integration Settings](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations) within the Aikido app.
2. In the 'Task Trackers' section, select 'YouTrack'\
   A modal will request the **Service URL** (of your YouTrack space) and the **Permanent Token**. The permanent token can be generated inside Profile -&gt; Account Security in YouTrack.\
