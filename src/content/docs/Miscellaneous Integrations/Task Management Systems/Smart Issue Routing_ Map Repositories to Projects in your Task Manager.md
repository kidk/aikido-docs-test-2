title: Smart Issue Routing_ Map Repositories to Projects in your Task Manager
---


## Introduction

Mapping your repositories to projects within your Task Manager ensures that automated tasks are correctly routed to the appropriate project.

## Main Use Case

Automatically ensure tasks created from repository activity are directed to the correct project in your task management tool.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1**: Navigate to the [**Task Manager Settings**](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations/tasktracker)

**Step 2**: Select **Repo Mapping**.

**Step 3: Map** your Task Tracker Projects to your Repos\
Here, you can configure which repositories map to specific projects.\

> **Important**: Don't forget to set a **default project**. This project acts as a fallback for any repositories not explicitly mapped, ensuring no task goes unassigned.

**Extra notes**

- This option is not included in GitHub Issues / GitLab Issues.
- For Linear, we do not map the projects, but the Teams
