title: Monitor Outbound Domains
---


Zen by Aikido allows you to monitor outbound domains and IP addresses.

### Use Cases

- **Detection of Shadow IT:** are developers knowingly or unknowingly sharing production data with 3rd parties (eg [api.openai.com](http://api.openai.com) )
- **PII Leakage**: Avoid accidental leakage of PII or sensitive data to 3rd parties
- **Compliance:** Map existing data streams for compliance.

> When you have setup Zen, outbound domain monitoring works **out-of-the-box.** 

### Future

- Block certain outbound domains so app is safe against SSRF
- PII leakage to unsanctioned 3rd party services

### How to monitor your outbound domains

Select a specific app and continue to the Outbound Domains tab. You will get a full overview of all outbound domains.
