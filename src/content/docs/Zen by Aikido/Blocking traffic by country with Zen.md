title: Blocking traffic by country with Zen
---


Zen by Aikido helps you control access to your application based on geographic location. This feature enhances your security measures by providing precise control over which countries can access your application.

> **Important**: Country blocking operates independently of the global "[Blocking/Detection Mode](https://help.aikido.dev/doc/blocking-vs-detection-mode-in-zen/docG796GDsFs)" setting. When you enable country blocks, they will always be enforced, even if Zen is in Detection Mode.

## Use Cases

- 🛡️ **Comply with Regulations**: Restrict access from countries based on compliance requirements

- 💰 **Reduce Fraud**: Block traffic from high-risk regions known for malicious activities

- 🔒 **Data Protection**: Limit access to specific geographic regions for data sovereignty

- ⚡ **Focus Resources**: Optimize performance by serving only your target markets

## How to block country traffic

Select a specific app and continue to the **Firewall** tab. Click the "**Manage Countries**" next to "**Block Traffic by Countries**" to configure Country blocking.
