title: Windsurf IDE

Aikido integrates with Windsurf and scans your codebases for **secrets, API keys** and **SAST** code issues. It runs scans whenever you open or save a file.

Every time you make and save changes in a file, a scan runs. If any issues are detected, they are highlighted in the editor and also displayed in the Problems panel. When you hover over a detected SAST issue, additional context about the problem is provided.
