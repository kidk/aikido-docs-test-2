Aikido helps you manage virtual machines by denoising results and reducing scanning frequency for non-production environments. 

> If the purpose of your connected cloud is set to **"mixed,"** you need to configure VM environments manually.

### How to configure your VM environments

**Step 1:** Navigate to the [**Virtual Machines** page](https://app.aikido.dev/virtual-machines)

**Step 2:** Click the **triple dots** menu for the VM you want to configure, and select **Edit Configuration**.
