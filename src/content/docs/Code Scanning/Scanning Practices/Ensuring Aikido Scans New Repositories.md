title: Ensuring Aikido Scans New Repositories
---


By default, Aikido will not enable scanning on newly created repositories that you did not previously enable. You can change this default behaviour.

**Step 1**. Go to [Settings/ repositories](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/integrations/repositories)

**Step 2.** Click 'Actions' dropdown on the top right and select **Repository Settings**.

**Step 3**. Enable the slider to make sure any new repository added from that point on will be scanned.
