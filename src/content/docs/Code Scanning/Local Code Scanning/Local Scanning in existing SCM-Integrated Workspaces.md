title: Local Scanning in existing SCM-Integrated Workspaces
---


> This functionality is not by default enabled. Contact the Aikido team for more info.

You can use the Local Scanning functionality directly within SCM-integrated workspaces, i.e. those connected to GitHub, GitLab (self-managed), Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps. Previously, this required creating a separate workspace, but Aikido now allows seamless integration of both functionalities in a single workspace.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up local scanning, ensure the following:

- You are on an **Aikido Pro Plan**.
- **Local scanning functionality is activated** by contacting the Aikido team.

### Local scanning setup

**Step 1**: Open your existing Aikido workspace (GitHub, GitLab, etc)

**Step 2**: Go to [General Settings](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/account) and click Local Scan Setup
