title: Account Setup with Multiple Gits
---


If you have repositories with multiple Git Providers (such as GitHub and GitLab) and you want to quickly access them, this is possible by setting up multiple workspaces that are connected to those specific Gits.

## Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1:** Add a new workspace by clicking your profile icon in the top right corner.

**Step 2:** Click "Logout" on the top right if you need to connect to a different Git provider. If it is the same Git provider, continue by selecting "Add a New Workspace."

**Step 3:** Choose the preferred Git Provider on the login screen.
