title: Assign Team Responsibilities by Specific Path in Repo
---


Assigning specific repo paths to teams in Aikido can help to streamline issue management in **large monorepos** and enabling **more granular reporting**.

### Use Cases

- **Monorepo management:** Assign specific paths to teams instead of the full monorepo. This allows you to filter your feed in a more granular way.
- **Specific reporting:** Allows reports to be generated based on service-level/path-level rather than at the repo level.

### Assigning Specific Paths

**Step 1:** Create a Team and Link Repositories (see [article](https://help.aikido.dev/doc/managing-access-with-teams/docfSBI1heYx))

- Create a new team or select an existing one, then link the relevant repositories to this team.

**Step 2:** Click Limit Access By Path in the dropdown menu

**Step 3:** Enter the paths within the repo that you want the team to have access to.

**Step 4:** Filter Issues in Feed/Reports

Go to the **Feed** or **Reports** section. Apply a filter based on the team, and you will see only the issues related to the paths assigned to that team.
