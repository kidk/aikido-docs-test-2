title: GitHub Integration for Authentication and User Management

## Introduction

Aikido ensures a one-to-one mapping with your GitHub organizations, including repositories, and teams. This streamlines the onboarding and offboarding processes within Aikido. 

## Understanding Aikido's GitHub Integration

- **Automatic Onboarding**: Thanks to the one-to-one mapping with GitHub organizations, all GitHub org members can easily onboard themselves to Aikido workspaces. This eliminates the need for manual email invitations. As soon as a user is part of the GitHub org, they will be able to access the workspace directly.
- **Effortless Offboarding**: When a member is removed from your GitHub organization, they automatically lose access to the Aikido workspace.
- **Synchronization of Teams and Repositories**: Aikido replicates your GitHub team structure and repository access controls. If your GitHub setup involves managing repository access through team memberships, Aikido will automatically and instantly mirror this structure, ensuring access levels remain consistent across both platforms.
- **Instant Syncing**: Instant syncing for adding & removing members, changing teams, changing repos on a team. All changes done in GitHub will instantly be reflected in Aikido.
- **Limitations for Outside Collaborators**: It's important to note that only full members of your GitHub organization can join the Aikido workspace. This means outside collaborators, even though they may have access to your GitHub repositories, will not be granted access to Aikido, ensuring workspace access is limited to your core team. If you want to add these users, you can also invite them via Google/Microsoft (see below).
