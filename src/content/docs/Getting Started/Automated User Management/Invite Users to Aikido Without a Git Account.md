Aikido provides flexible options for inviting users who do not have a GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab account or prefer using alternative login methods such as Google, Microsoft, or a personal GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab account. 

## Use Cases

- **Billing Personnel**: Users responsible for billing who do not have a Git account.
- **Personal GitHub Account Users**: Users with a personal GitHub account not affiliated with the organization.
- **Freelancers**: Contractors needing partial or temporary access.
- **Auditors**: External auditors requiring temporary access.
- **BitBucket users with limited-access to repos:** Users that only have limited access to a certain repos in BitBucket.

## Steps to Invite Users

**Step 1**: Navigate to the [Users Section](https://app.aikido.dev/settings/users) in Settings. Click **'Add'** to open the user invite dialogue

**Step 2**: Enter one or multiple **email address**. The email needs to be a company email.

**Step 4.** Ensure that the invited user clicks the button in the email redirecting to Aikido and then using its email that was used during invite for Google/Microsoft.

### Important Notes

- **Manual Offboarding**: Users invited via these methods **will not** be automatically offboarded. It is important to manually remove users who no longer require access to the Aikido platform to maintain security and manage access appropriately.
